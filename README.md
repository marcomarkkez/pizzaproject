## Welcome to the Mendoza Corporation, PIZZA code exercise 🍕🍕🍕

We'd like to get to know your skillset and style. We have this "application", 
designed to let a user create a list of the toppings they want on their pizza.  
We store this list on the backend in case the user leaves the application
and returns to the application at a later time. Normally this would be done
in a database, but for this exercise we are using a PHP session.

There is one problem 🤔 -- it doesn't allow the user to remove a topping if
they change their mind. 😑

* We'd like you to add that functionality to the application.
* We would prefer you stick to AJAX so that the imaginary part of the application interface does not have to be reloaded.
* Aside from that, you have complete creative freedom.
* When you finish the test, create a repo in your favorite Repo Server and answer the email with your repo link

So, this is your time to shine! ⭐⭐⭐
Show us who you are and what you can do 💪💪💪

Use images, css, javascipt that you would like. Make us say WOW!!! 🤩🤩🤩

If you have any questions, need any help or explanation of any of the
code below, please don't hesitate to contact saul@unilinktransportation.com
